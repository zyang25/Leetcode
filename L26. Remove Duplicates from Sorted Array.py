# Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

# Example:

# Given nums = [1,1,2],
#[1,1,1,1,1]
#[1,2,3,3]
#[1,2,2,2,3,3,3] -

# Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
# It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
